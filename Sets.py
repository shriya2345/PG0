"""
a = {1,2,3,4,5}
b = {4,5,6,7,8}

Union means addition of sets
a U b = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

Internsection means the common elements between two sets
a intersection B = {4,5}
c = {1,2,3}
d = {4,5,6}
c intersection d = None

difference of A and B is the elements that exist in A but not in B
a = {1,2,3,4,5}
b = {4,5,6,7,8}
a - b = {1,2,3}
b - a = {6,7,8}

Symmetric difference is (union of sets - intersection of sets)
a = {1,2,3,4,5}
b = {4,5,6,7,8}
a symDiff b = {1,2,3,6,7,8}
